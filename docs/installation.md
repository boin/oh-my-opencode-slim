## For Humans

### Quick Install

Run the interactive installer:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

Or use non-interactive mode:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --no-tui --skills=yes --background-subagents=yes
```

### Configuration Options

The installer supports the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skills=yes|no` | Install bundled skills (default: yes) |
| `--preset=<name>` | Active generated config preset: `openai` or `opencode-go` (default: `openai`) |
| `--background-subagents=ask\|yes\|no` | Configure the required background-subagents environment export (`ask` by default; prompt defaults to yes) |
| `--background-subagents-target=<path>` | Write the background-subagents export to a specific shell/profile file |
| `--no-tui` | Non-interactive mode |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate install without writing files |
| `--reset` | Force overwrite of existing configuration |

### Background Subagents Environment Setup

Background orchestration is the default workflow. It depends on OpenCode's native
background subagents, which are enabled by this environment variable:

```bash
OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true
```

The installer asks before adding that export to your shell startup file. The
prompt defaults to `yes` because V2's default orchestration depends on it.

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

For non-interactive setup, pass the choice explicitly:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --no-tui --background-subagents=yes
```

After the installer updates a shell startup file, restart your terminal or source
the file before launching OpenCode. Examples:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
# or
source ~/.bashrc
```

For a one-shot manual launch without restarting your terminal:

```bash
OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true opencode
```

### Non-Destructive Behavior

By default, the installer is non-destructive. If an `oh-my-opencode-slim.json` configuration file already exists, the installer will **not** overwrite it. Instead, it will display a message:

```
[i] Configuration already exists at ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json. Use --reset to overwrite.
```

To force overwrite of your existing configuration, use the `--reset` flag:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --reset
```

**Note:** When using `--reset`, the installer creates a `.bak` backup file before overwriting, so your previous configuration is preserved.

### After Installation

The installer generates both OpenAI and OpenCode Go presets, with OpenAI active by default (using variant-aware `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.4-mini` models, including `gpt-5.5 (medium)` for Orchestrator, `gpt-5.5 (high)` for Oracle, `gpt-5.5 (low)` for Fixer, and `gpt-5.4-mini` variants for other specialists). To make OpenCode Go active during install, run `bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --preset=opencode-go`. That preset uses GLM-5.1 for Orchestrator, so the installer also enables Observer with `opencode-go/kimi-k2.6` for visual analysis. To switch providers later or build a mixed setup, use **[Configuration Reference](configuration.md)** for the full option reference and the preset docs for copyable examples.

Then:

```bash
opencode auth login
# Select your provider and complete OAuth flow
```

```bash
opencode models --refresh
```

Open your generated config at `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`
and adjust models if needed.

Then run OpenCode and verify the agents:

```text
ping all agents
```

> **💡 Tip: Models are fully customizable.** The installer sets sensible defaults, but you can assign *any* model to *any* agent. Edit `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc` for comments support) to override models, adjust reasoning effort, or disable agents entirely.

### Alternative: Ask Any Coding Agent

Paste this into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any coding agent:

## For LLM Agents

If you're an LLM Agent helping set up oh-my-opencode-slim, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Check OpenCode Installation

```bash
opencode --version
```

If not installed, direct the user to https://opencode.ai/docs first.

### Step 2: Run the Installer

The installer generates OpenAI and OpenCode Go presets, with OpenAI active by default:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --no-tui --skills=yes
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive install
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install

# Non-interactive with bundled skills
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --no-tui --skills=yes --background-subagents=yes

# Make the generated OpenCode Go preset active
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --preset=opencode-go

# Non-interactive without skills
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --no-tui --skills=no

# Force overwrite existing configuration
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --reset
```

The installer automatically:
- Adds the plugin to `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc` in
  `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, otherwise `~/.config/opencode`
- Disables default OpenCode agents
- Enables OpenCode LSP integration when no explicit `lsp` setting exists
- Configures `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` when approved
- Generates agent model mappings in the same OpenCode config directory as
  `oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`)

### Step 3: Authenticate with Providers

Ask user to run the following command. Don't run it yourself, it requires user interaction.

```bash
opencode auth login
# Select your provider and complete OAuth flow
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Ask the user to:

1. Authenticate: `opencode auth login`
2. Refresh models: `opencode models --refresh`
3. Restart the terminal or source the shell file updated by the installer
   (`source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`), then start OpenCode: `opencode`
   - One-shot alternative: `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true opencode`
4. Run: `ping all agents`

Verify all agents respond successfully.

**Crucial Advice for the User:**
- They can easily assign **different models to different agents** by editing `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`).
- If they want to add a different provider later (OpenCode Go, Kimi, GitHub Copilot, ZAI), they can update this file manually. See **[Configuration Reference](configuration.md)** and the preset docs for examples.
- Read the generated `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`) file to understand the current configuration.

### Step 4.5: Verify Active Plugin Source (Fork-Specific)

The npm package `oh-my-opencode-slim` resolves to **upstream**, which does
NOT carry the fork's `spec_propose` / `spec_merge` / `spec_archive` /
`trace_regenerate` tools or the grill skill. Do not skip this step — the
remaining fork-specific steps are no-ops if the loaded plugin is upstream.

Decision tree for the agent:

1. **First attempt** — install from GitHub:
   ```bash
   opencode plugin install boin/oh-my-opencode-slim
   ```
   If this succeeds, jump to the verification gate below.

2. **Fallback if step 1 fails with `git dep preparation failed`** —
   local checkout:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boin/oh-my-opencode-slim.git \
     ~/.config/opencode/plugins/oh-my-opencode-slim-sdd
   cd ~/.config/opencode/plugins/oh-my-opencode-slim-sdd
   bun install && bun run build
   ```
   Then edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and add the absolute
   path as a string entry in the `plugin` array (alongside any other
   plugins). Do not put it under `plugin.<name>`; it is a plain
   string entry.

3. **Verification gate (mandatory, runs regardless of which path
   succeeded above):**
   ```bash
   grep -l spec_propose \
     ~/.config/opencode/plugins/oh-my-opencode-slim-sdd/dist/index.js
   # — or, if installed via opencode plugin install: —
   grep -rl spec_propose ~/.local/share/opencode/plugins/oh-my-opencode-slim*/dist/
   ```
   A hit means the fork is loaded. **No hit** means upstream is loaded —
   stop, undo, and re-do steps 1 or 2.

### Step 5: Apply the SDD/TDD Preset (Fork-Specific)

This fork ships an opinionated preset wired for **Opus brain + GPT hands + Gemini at edges**, with `memex` as the cross-session memory and `@oracle` as the sole writer.

Reference: `docs/spec/preset-example.jsonc` in the fork source.

Decision tree for the agent:

1. **User has a private gateway (model names are not official):**
   - First add a custom provider to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "provider": {
         "<alias>": {
           "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
           "name": "<Gateway Name>",
           "options": {
             "baseURL": "https://<gateway>/v1",
             "apiKey": "{env:<ALIAS>_API_KEY}"
           },
           "models": {
             "claude":  { "name": "<alias> Claude (Opus-class)" },
             "gpt":     { "name": "<alias> GPT-5.5" },
             "gemini":  { "name": "<alias> Gemini Pro" }
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Then in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`, replace every `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` with `<alias>/claude`, every `openai/gpt-5.5` with `<alias>/gpt`, and `google/gemini-3-pro` (in council `gamma`) with `<alias>/gemini`.
   - If different real models live on different gateways, split into multiple providers (`<alias>-claude`, `<alias>-gpt`, ...) rather than stuffing one block.

2. **User uses official providers:** copy `docs/spec/preset-example.jsonc` verbatim into `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`, then run `opencode models --refresh` and adjust model IDs to whatever the refresh lists (provider tails sometimes carry version suffixes).

**Variants in the preset (do not silently flatten):**
- `oracle.variant: high` — high reasoning effort, used at entry/output review gates.
- `librarian/explorer/fixer.variant: low` — cheap execution.
- `designer.variant: medium` — UI polish needs more thought than rote edits.

**Council requires three edges (alpha / beta / gamma):**
The council agent is a three-edge debate, not a single model. Omitting
`gamma` silently degrades it to two edges — the third edge IS the
disagreement signal, not a fallback. Both council blocks below are
valid skeletons:

```jsonc
// Gateway variant — gamma is the gateway-mapped Gemini
"council": {
  "model":  "<alias>/claude",   // alpha (presiding)
  "alpha":  { "model": "<alias>/claude" },
  "beta":   { "model": "<alias>/gpt" },
  "gamma":  { "model": "<alias>/gemini" }
}

// Official-providers variant
"council": {
  "model":  "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7",
  "alpha":  { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7" },
  "beta":   { "model": "openai/gpt-5.5" },
  "gamma":  { "model": "google/gemini-3-pro" }
}
```

If the third edge is genuinely unavailable in the user's environment,
substitute another model from a different provider family (e.g. a free
DeepSeek/Qwen tier) rather than dropping `gamma` entirely.

### Step 6: Install memex MCP and Respect Its Write Boundary

The preset wires `memex` to `orchestrator` (read) and `oracle` (read + write). This is enforced at the **prompt level**, not the config level — the agent must not save memories from any role other than `@oracle`.

1. Install per memex upstream docs (https://github.com/getmemex/memex). Ensure it appears as an available MCP in `opencode mcp list`.

2. Verify the preset already includes `"memex"` in:
   - `presets.<active>.orchestrator.mcps`
   - `presets.<active>.oracle.mcps`

3. Tell the user:
   - `@oracle` is the **sole writer**. Pitfall lessons + good-pattern notes only.
   - `@orchestrator` is a **reader**. It calls `recall_memories` before launching each subtask.
   - Never let other agents (`fixer`, `librarian`, `explorer`, `designer`) touch memex — they are not in the preset by design.

4. Sanity check after first run:
   ```text
   @oracle: save a test memory tagged "smoke-test"
   @orchestrator: recall memories tagged "smoke-test"
   ```
   Both should succeed. Then have the user delete the test card.

### Step 7: Initialize SDD Spec Directory in the Target Project

The fork's orchestrator follows an SDD/TDD workflow that expects `docs/spec/{requirements,design,trace}.md` in the project being worked on (not in the fork itself).

For each new project the user wants to drive with this fork:

1. From the project root:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/spec
   ```

2. Start `opencode` and tell the orchestrator:
   ```text
   /grill <one-paragraph description of what you want to build>
   ```

3. The orchestrator will:
   - Enter the four-phase grill (assumptions → risks → self-answerable Qs → human-decision Qs).
   - For every external dependency mentioned, force both **read** and **write** responsibilities to be defined.
   - Converge within **3 rounds** or halt with the residual question list.
   - Emit `docs/spec/requirements.md` and `docs/spec/design.md`.
   - Run `trace_regenerate` to produce `docs/spec/trace.md`.

4. From that point on, the orchestrator self-injects the SDD/TDD discipline block at every turn (via `buildSddTddAppendBlock`) and the `trace-freshness` hook auto-regenerates `trace.md` whenever `requirements.md` or `design.md` is touched. No further user action needed for housekeeping.

**If the project is trivial** (typo / one-line fix / no spec-worthy behavior change) the orchestrator skips grill and goes straight to direct-commit per the routing rules in the discipline block.

### Step 8: Interaction Discipline (Fork-Specific)

The orchestrator and grill skill default to "make the reasonable call
and keep going" — unnecessary stops to confirm taste-free decisions are
an anti-pattern, not politeness. Stop and ask the user ONLY when one
of these three categories fires:

1. **Genuine human-only judgment** — business priority, scope/quality
   tradeoff, taste call the agent cannot derive from code, spec, or
   docs. Example: "ship the partial fix Friday or hold for the proper
   one Monday".
2. **Irreversible side effect about to happen** — destructive git
   (`reset --hard`, force-push, branch deletion), external API write,
   production deploy, money, messages to other humans, anything the
   user can't trivially undo.
3. **Scope explosion past what was approved** — the task as briefed
   implied N files / M lines and the agent now sees it needs 3×N or
   10×M; reconfirm scope before continuing rather than silently
   ballooning.

Everything outside those three is the agent's call: routing (worktree
vs PR vs direct-commit), model picks within an existing preset, file
layout, test framework conventions, naming. Do not stop to confirm any
of these. If the agent stopped you for something not in the list,
treat it as a process bug and tell it to keep going.

For spec authoring specifically (the grill skill's phase 4), the same
rule applies in a stricter form: any question that grep, a file read,
or a doc fetch could answer belongs in phase 3, not phase 4. See
`src/skills/grill/SKILL.md` § Anti-patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Installer Fails

Check the expected config format:
```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --help
```

Then manually create the config files at:
- `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` (or `.jsonc`)

### Configuration Already Exists

If the installer reports that the configuration already exists, you have two options:

1. **Keep existing config**: The installer will skip the configuration step and continue with other operations (like adding the plugin or installing skills).

2. **Reset configuration**: Use `--reset` to overwrite:
   ```bash
   bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --reset
   ```
   A `.bak` backup file will be created automatically.

### Agents Not Responding

1. Check your authentication:
   ```bash
   opencode auth status
   ```

2. From your project root, verify your config file exists and is valid:
   ```bash
   bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest doctor
   ```

3. Check that your provider is configured in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

### Missing Background Task Tools

If background tasks never
return task IDs, or delegation behaves like a blocking foreground call:

1. Confirm OpenCode was launched with the environment variable:
   ```bash
   env | grep OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS
   ```
   It should show `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true`.

   Also use an OpenCode release that includes native background
   subagents; run `opencode --version` and update OpenCode if background tasks are missing.

2. Restart your terminal or source the shell file the installer updated, then
   start OpenCode again. Plain `opencode` is only sufficient after that
   environment is active.

3. For a quick manual test, launch OpenCode with a one-shot export:
   ```bash
   OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true opencode
   ```

4. If shell setup was missing, rerun the installer:
   ```bash
   bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
   ```

### Authentication Issues

If providers are not working:

1. Check your authentication status:
   ```bash
   opencode auth status
   ```

2. Re-authenticate if needed:
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```

3. Verify your config file has the correct provider configuration:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json
   ```

### Editor Validation

Add a `$schema` reference to your config for autocomplete and inline validation:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/oh-my-opencode-slim@latest/oh-my-opencode-slim.schema.json",
  // your config...
}
```

Works in VS Code, Neovim (with `jsonls`), and any editor that supports JSON Schema. Catches typos and wrong nesting immediately.

### Tmux Integration Not Working

Make sure you're running OpenCode with the `--port` flag and the port matches your `OPENCODE_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
tmux
export OPENCODE_PORT=4096
opencode --port 4096
```

See the [Multiplexer Integration Guide](multiplexer-integration.md) for more details.

## Uninstallation

1. **Remove the plugin from your OpenCode config**:

   Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and remove `"oh-my-opencode-slim"` from the `plugin` array.

2. **Remove configuration files (optional)**:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json
   rm -f ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json.bak
   ```

3. **Remove skills (optional)**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/simplify
   rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/codemap
   rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/clonedeps
   ```
